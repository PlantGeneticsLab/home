<h1>ABOUT US </h1>
<br>
<p class="p">
We are a research group in <a href="http://english.genetics.cas.cn/"><bold>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB)</bold></a>, <a href="http://english.cas.cn/"><bold>Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)</bold></a>. 
The lab is also affiliated to <a href="https://www.cepams.org/about-cepams/"><bold>Centre of Excellence for Plant and Microbial Sciences (CEPAMS)</bold></a>, established by CAS and <a href="https://www.jic.ac.uk/"><bold>John Innes Centre (JIC)</bold></a>. 
By leveraging quantitative genetics and statistical genomics approaches, we are trying to pinpoint genetic control of important agronomic traits (e.g. yield, heterosis, nutritional value, disease resistance, etc) for crop improvement.

<p class="p" style="text-indent:1cm">
Currently, we are working on wheat, which accounts for one third of global grain production. Research progress on major crops will lead to large-scale technology application, and thus tremendously benefit all people. In the near future, agriculture will face more challenges from growing population,  increasing environmental concerns, and climate change. As a response, in the long term, we are committed to developing cutting-edge technologies to help implement a productive and sustainable strategy in agriculture development.
